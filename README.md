# ThirtyFifteenCurb

#### Simple mod which utilizes curb height adjusting script by injecting it at specific time of savegame loading process.
Internal script code attempts to find all -30cm roads and lifts them to -15cm. Doesn't work for LOD.

The mod greatly reduce execution time compared to original script because network assets information are processed before game start rendering - no need to update already rendered objects.
